## CORS

While in development, you can use this chrome extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc/related?hl=en-US to get the data without triggering a CORS MissingAllowOriginHeader. In a real world situation we'd set up a proxy.

## Project setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](docs/createReactApp.md).
